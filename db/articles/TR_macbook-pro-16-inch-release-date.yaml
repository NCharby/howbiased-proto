    Apple’s original MacBook Pro 16-inch emerged in <mark class="h">November 2019</mark>, making a splash with its bigger display which provided more screen real-estate without increasing the actual size of the laptop compared to the MacBook Pro 15-inch it replaced.

    The follow-up 16-inch model has been keenly awaited, but with no sign of anything happening since that initial late 2019 launch – save for a low-key GPU upgrade in 2020 – some folks are perhaps getting impatient to see the sequel to this larger-screened model.

    Mainly because aside from that step up in <mark class="t">screen size (with way slimmer bezels)</mark>, the overall design wasn’t changed all that much – but the next MacBook Pro 16-inch is expected to make some big moves on the design front, going by the many rumors which have been swirling around. That could include ditching the Touch Bar and bringing back MagSafe, plus rumors have also abounded regarding the possibility of a new Mini-LED screen.

    Furthermore, Apple now has its impressive M1 chip, and the prospect of pepping up this model of MacBook Pro with what could be the sequel to the M1 – which rumors indicate may be considerably more powerful – is a seriously enticing one too.

    Read on for the full details on what we can expect from the new MacBook Pro 16-inch, not to mention when we can expect it to arrive.

    Cut to the chase
    - What is it? The successor to the original MacBook Pro 16-inch
    - When is it out? Q3 of 2021 most likely
    - What will it cost? Unknown, but likely similar to current pricing ($2,399 or £2,399, AU$3,799)
